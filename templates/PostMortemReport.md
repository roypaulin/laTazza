They will not be used to grade the project> # Requirements<Report here your observations, if any, about the requirement document produced by the first deadline><Would you do it differently now?>Defenitely yes!! if we had to redo the requirements we should have done it differently because i think the one we did at the beginning contained a lot of not needed functionalities for the system to work properly.# Design<Report here your observations, if any, about the design  document produced by the second  deadline><Would you do it differently now?>At the end of the day, our design was quite good because it provide to us a good flexibility in writting the and we did not also have big issues in fixing the future issues so, we could keep it.# Code and test cases<Report here your observations, if any, about the test cases and code produced by the third and fourth deadline>Tests cases were not as easy as we thougth there were at the beginnig and in fact, we spent more time testing than coding# ChangesThere have been kind of usefull because it made us understand how the design was really important because it may impact on future changes related to the software.<Report here your observations, if any, about the three change cycles corresponding to deadlines 5,6,7># Build, tools and environment<Report here your observations, if any, about the tools and environment used>The tools used were during all the phases(Requirements,Design,Coding,Testing)were quite interesting and helpful, but regarding the enviroment used for the build on git it was often too slow!!# Other observations<Report here any other comment or suggestion >We think that the course in general was well structured and the project very helpfull because we faced a lot of issues NOT only related to coding but often also to coding or testing enviroment and also to the build ebviroment; We now understand better the famous sentence "Software is not only about coding!!", it has also been a way for us to develop our team wok skill. However in order to improve the student experince during the project, we will suggest the following:*Improve the response time on slack, especially during the week-end when we are closed to the deadline; or if it's not possible for you teachers to be available during the wee-end, it may be a good idea to posticipate the deadline and put in working days.*try to provide if possible feedbacks about the work done after each delivery.*improve if possible the building tool because the actual one is quite slow!!
