|         Total person days worked by your  team, considering period March 5 to April 26 (1 person day == 8 person hours)     |   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
|Total Java LoC delivered on April 26 (only code, no Junit code) | |
| Total number of Java classes delivered on April 26 (only code, no Junit code)| |
| Productivity P =| |
|Average size of Java class A = | |

**nb:** we had used an automated command for calculating that lines, it is
replicable and works also in the future, following the code:
```bash
cd src/main && find . -name *.java -exec grep [a-zA-Z0-9{}] {} \; | wc -l
```
